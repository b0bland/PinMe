PinME is a website that looks up events based on the type of genre the user picks. Geolocation is used to get the user's location. The inputs are presented as drop-down menus, and the user can choose between many different genres, as well as when the event will be and whether or not the event is paid or free. The website searches within a 100 mile radius of the user if the geolocation request is allowed, and results are limited to 10. The search results will also appear as pins on the Google Map below the results. Four Spotify playlists related to the genre searched will appear above the results.
